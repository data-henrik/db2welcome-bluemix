db2welcome-bluemix
==================

code for my Welcome DB2 project on IBM Bluemix, some of it has been described on my blog http://blog.4loeser.net

The code shows how to combine DB2 and Python on IBM Bluemix (http://bluemix.net). It requires either a free trial or a regular account and the creation of a SQL DB (DB2) service. The tables (schema.sql) are created using the administration interface, then the data loaded.

Some steps are documented in the following blog articles:
